I am Ahmed, a third year student in the Faculty of Computer Science, for the past two years I have done my studies hard in this field, and managed to get a GPA = 3.75.  I studied many subjects related to software engineering and got high marks in them.  In addition to the college, I was building myself to become qualified for the market, so I watched many courses and built many projects, and I joined the ICPC community in the college, and this contributed to the development of my level in algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving. The total of what I solved for them is +300 problems.  Currently, I aspire to take real training that will strengthen me in the field of the Backend, after I loved working on it, including dealings with the server and databases, especially since most of my projects took care of this part within the limits of my capabilities.  I also have experience in Html, Css, and Js languages, and I have built some beautiful projects and interfaces with them.  I look forward to working with you, Atos.
